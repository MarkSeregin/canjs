## Ensure a consistent design across your apps

Your organization has multiple projects that need a consistent design. Building a reusable, shared component library and design system will help you achieve this goal.

CanJS is built on a web standard called [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements), which allow you create HTML elements that can be reused anywhere HTML is usable. Use Angular, React, Vue, or a mix of these in your projects? CanJSâ€™s components can be reused in all of these.

Create one design system for your apps and build those components once for all of your projects with CanJS.
