## Create cross-framework components

Your team has multiple projects that use different technologies: legacy apps built with AngularJS, new apps built with React, and even newer apps built with Hot Framework 3000. But you shouldn’t have to rebuild the same common elements between all these projects just because they use a different framework.

CanJS helps you build reusable components that can be used with every framework. CanJS is built on [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements), which are a standard web technology. Since they’re just JavaScript, they can be embedded anywhere plain HTML can go, including Angular, React, Vue, and more.

Start creating components with CanJS that can be shared across all your projects.
