## Model layer

Components shouldn‚Äôt be concerned with how data is fetched, updated, or cached.

CanJS provides the right abstractions for your model code to be cleanly separated from your UI code. [Learn more‚Ä¶](./readme-feature-model-layer.md)

## Promises in templates

CanJS‚Äôs [stache templating language](https://canjs.com/doc/can-stache.html) can directly read the state and values from [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

No need to write any extra code to determine whether a Promise is pending, resolved, or rejected. [Learn more‚Ä¶](./readme-feature-promises-in-templates.md)

```handlebars
{{# if(this.promise.isPending) }}
  Loading‚Ä¶
{{/ if }}
{{# if(this.promise.isRejected) }}
  Error: {{ this.promise.reason }}
{{/ if }}
{{# if(this.promise.isResolved) }}
  Result: {{ this.promise.value }}
{{/ if }}
```

## Real-time list updating

After data is created, updated, or destroyed, CanJS automatically updates your lists for you.

Filtering and sorting are preserved, so you don‚Äôt have to manually update your lists or fetch the same data again. [Learn more‚Ä¶](./readme-feature-real-time-list-updating.md)

## We have your back

CanJS is backed by [Bitovi](https://www.bitovi.com/), a company built on using and publishing open source software. We answer every question on [our Slack](https://bitovi.com/community/slack) and [our Discourse forums](https://forums.bitovi.com/). We want to help you get started with CanJS!

## Get started with just a few lines of code

Below is an entire app that shows off some of the best features of CanJS:

- One line of code to create a model from the data returned by a backend API (with [realtimeRestModel](https://canjs.com/doc/can-realtime-rest-model.html)).
- `isPending`, `isRejected`, `isResolved`, and value helpers for directly reading the state of a Promise.
- When you add a to-do, it automatically gets inserted into the list in the right position.

Example on CodePen: https://codepen.io/bitovi/pen/dBawyZ

*Type in a new to-do and click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù to see it appear in the list. Notice that new to-dos are inserted in alphabetical order, without any code that explicitly inserts the new one in the right place!*
