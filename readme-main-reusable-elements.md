## Interoperable, cross-framework components

Your organization uses multiple frameworks across different projects. You shouldn‚Äôt have to reimplement the same basic components because they‚Äôre used with different frameworks.

CanJS saves you time by helping you create reusable components that can be used with any framework. [Learn more‚Ä¶](./readme-feature-cross-framework-components.md)

## Implement designs consistently

Sharing a consistent design across multiple projects is difficult when different teams are reimplementing the same design.

Create a reusable component library that can be used with any framework. [Learn more‚Ä¶](./readme-feature-consistent-design.md)

## Use thousands of pre-made components

The number of readily-available custom elements are growing every day. Websites such as webcomponents.org make it easy to find thousands of custom elements that you can use in your project.

Save your team time by reusing thousands of readily-available custom elements. [Learn more‚Ä¶](./readme-feature-pre-made-components.md)

## We have your back

CanJS is backed by [Bitovi](https://www.bitovi.com/), a company built on using and publishing open source software. We answer every question on [our Slack](https://bitovi.com/community/slack) and [our Discourse forums](https://forums.bitovi.com/). We want to help you get started with CanJS!

## Get started with just a few lines of code

Below is an entire app that shows off some of the best features of CanJS:

- One line of code to create a model from the data returned by a backend API (with [realtimeRestModel](https://canjs.com/doc/can-realtime-rest-model.html)).
- The `props` include rules for type checking and conversion (with [type](https://canjs.com/doc/can-type.html)).
- When you add a to-do, it automatically gets inserted into the list in the right position.

Example on CodePen: https://codepen.io/bitovi/pen/dBawyZ

*Type in a new to-do and click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù to see it appear in the list. Notice that new to-dos are inserted in alphabetical order, without any code that explicitly inserts the new one in the right place!*
