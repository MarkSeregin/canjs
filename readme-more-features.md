## Adopt new technologies

CanJS adopts new best practices and technologies, and builds them into the framework.

You can continue to use older stuff in the same project as newer stuff. We support old packages.

## Easy migration

Codemods for everything.

## New versions share the same code

Everything is broken up into separate packages, and when only a part of the framework is touched in a major release, not every package gets a major version bump.

## Size

72KB gzipped, which includes everything you need for components, routing, and a robust model layer.

## Primitives exposed

You can build on the same building blocks that CanJS uses. Primitives for computed values, binding, and more are available.

## Rendering performance

VDOM requires diffing, instead we use observables to do minimal DOM updates.

## Testable components

Test just the model or the entire element.

## Error messages

Pre-emptive error messages to warn you about anti-patterns.
