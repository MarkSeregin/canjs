## Create components for any environment

CanJS is built on [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements), which are really easy to use: embed the script in the page and then use the HTML element like you would anywhere else.

CMS? Check. Markdown? Check. A plain JS app, or an app built with Angular, React, or another framework? Check.

Spend less time worrying whether your component is going to work in your userâ€™s environment and more time building great components.
